#This project is a quick and dirty demo using react to consume a property API and browse the properties

Feature complete within reasonable scope

#Known issues:

- infinite scroll not working
- Cannot close selected property window in map view
- enter requires double tap in autocomplete window
- Map is limited to a number of icons (probably because I haven't used an API key)
- API returns strange results and doesn't always filter as the spec implies. Possibly and API issue but maybe my default
